* I write this version by consulting disCNN\_new\_api.py, which can *seemingly* executed correctly(I found something wired in it).
* in  this version, the structure of network does not compeletely comply with the original paper
* disCifar10(newapi): line 22: get all training_examples in 1 time or only get a portion of data at the beginning?
* the bug in Andy's code may be related to the data accessing, if line 22 in disCNN is a bug
* or because there is difference between it and the original paper
